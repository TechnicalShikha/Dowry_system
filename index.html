 <p style="font-size:20px;color:green">It is a matter of great shame and slur on the indian society.It underlines the fact that women in india are not treated equally.Women are sought after as on prey to fulfil their sinister and nasty designs.It is against the law of equality of men and women.The government has banned it and declared it a crime yet the results are otherwise people maintain double standard in this regard.If shows that alone can not cater to the need of the hour.</p>

 <p style="font-size:20px;color:blue">Social awareness and effective measures are to play a pivotal role in eradicating this social malaise.Registration of marraige should be made compulsory pledging renunciation of taking dowry.More and more women should be encouraged to get employment so that they need not depend on their husband's income.Women should fight against all kinds of discrimination and unjust male-domination.Youths must deny to marry whenever their is a demand of dowry because if reduces a rejoiceful party to a status of a beggar.</p>
